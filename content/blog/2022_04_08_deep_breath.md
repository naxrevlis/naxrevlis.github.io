There are sometimes unexpected and extreme situations that happen. And due to the reaction of our ancient brain first intention is to react and move immediately to resolve the problem.

As a manager people, many people around you expect a fast reaction. But in such a situation, the best you can do is take a deep breath, wait 2-3 minutes, better if you move your attention to another subject, and then return to the problem.

This principle helps me every day, and since I implemented it into the day 2-day routine quality of my decisions became better than before.
